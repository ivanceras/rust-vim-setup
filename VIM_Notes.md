# Basic Controls
	CTRL-t 			open or close nerdtree
	CTRL-n 			toggle relative / absolute numbering
	CTRL-w w 		switch focus on nerdtree and open windows
	h,j,k,l			navigate the cursor left, down, up, right respectively
	i				insert mode, you can start typing in your code
	<ESC>   		go back to normal/default mode, where you can issue vi commands
	:w      		write/save the file, you are editing
	:wqa   			save the file, then quit the editor closing vi including the files tab
	<F2>			set focus on the nerd tree

## Rust specific commands

	CTRL-x CTRL-o   activate auto rust autocompeletion (example: type in `String::` then press CTRL-x CTRL-o then select from the drop down list the appropriate functions)
	gd              go to function/struct/variable declaration of the focused item ( this is equivalent to eclipse' open declaration )
	gD              go to declaration split open in window tab
	:bp             to go back to the previous edited file (very useful when following a declaration)
	:b <part of filename>  when you have open a lot of files, this comes in handy in showing back the previously open files
